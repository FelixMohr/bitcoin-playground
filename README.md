# bitcoin-playground

This app allows users to generate BTC SegWit addresses by providing a seed phrase (or generating a random phrase). It also allows for generating Multisignature (multi-sig) Pay-To-Script-Hash (P2SH) addresses.

## Used libraries

The main libraries that were used for address generation are [bitcoinjs-lib](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib) and [bip39](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip39).

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
